I made a new site. This post, which is probably going to be a perpetual work in progress, is about how it works.

This site has two components. The first is a Gatsby site, the second is a server built using [Express](http://expressjs.com/).

## Yarn Workspaces

Technically, this is a monorepo, it has two packages. I'm using [Yarn workspaces]() to manage it as a monorepo. I'm not using Lerna. The root package has [wsrun](https://github.com/hfour/wsrun) as a dependency, which is a great tool for running commands across multiple workspaces.

## Deployment
