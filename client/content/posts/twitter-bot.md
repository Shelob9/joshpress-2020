excerpt: This post is about creating a basic twitter bot to bring some of my tweets into my Gatsby site.

## Goals

I tweet a lot, it's a fun game. I have a few moves I enjoy overusing:

- "This Looks Neato" - Cool WordPress (mostly) things I want to promote and try out later. I want to automatically pull all of these tweets into a database or spreadsheat and create (draft?) posts on my site for each. Maybe, I'll write about them or ask others for their experience or ask the creator some questions -- I dunno...
- "Thank You For Sharing This With The Internet" I've been trying to be nicer and show more gratitude on Twitter. I think it would be fun to see all of these cool things that made me happy, in one gallery.
- "Strong Agreement" - For things I agree with. I might track these, but I don't want to get too attatched to my own agreement with myself.

There are a few others, that are just jokes and I'm not sure I want to track how invested I am in those.
