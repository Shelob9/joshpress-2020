I make commerical open source products and teach people how. Friendly nerd for PHP, Javascript, ecology, crypto, caffeine, music, Laravel, React, Docker, WordPress & sci-fi. Collecting information on the peer 2 peer future.

Right, now I work at at [Saturday Drive](https://SaturdayDrive.com), building WordPress-adjacent web applications, mainly with Laravel and React. I also help build many WordPress plugins.

## About Me

When I was a student of environmental studies, I loved to learn about plants and complex and emergent systems. Also, I loved to plant trees and measure things, but I always returned to my fascination with computers and the internet. Over time, I became interested in how online communities, especially open source software movements could provide a model for a more sustainable economy. So, I started blogging with WordPress, developing WordPress themes and plugins, contributing to WordPress core, speaking at WordCamps, co-founding and selling a WordPress plugin company, etc.

Now, I'm focusing on understanding more about how people use, benefit from and exploit the open web. I'm researching web3, and experimenting with multiplayer writing tools.
